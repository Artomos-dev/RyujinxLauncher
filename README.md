**A controller-first configuration interface for Ryujinx.**

Ryujinx Launcher is standalone middleware designed to eliminate the Keyboard and Mouse dependency in HTPC and Couch Gaming setups. It solves the frustration of shifting controller IDs by allowing you to visually assign physical controllers to Player Slots (1-8) using only a gamepad immediately before launch.

With features like hot-plug detection and a controller-based "Kill Combo" for exiting, it maintains complete immersion by removing the need to ever reach for a mouse or keyboard to fix configs or close the emulator.

**Note:** This project is a **companion utility/launcher**. It does not replace, fork, or modify the original Ryujinx emulator; it is intended to be used alongside it to streamline the input configuration process.

## Why use Ryujinx Launcher?
**No More Controller Shuffling:** Fixed the frustration of shifting controller IDs. If your Bluetooth controller connects in a different order, you can re-map it in seconds using only your gamepad.

**Total Immersion:** Designed specifically for HTPCs, Handheld PCs (Steam Deck/ROG Ally), and Couch Gaming where reaching for a mouse is a literal chore.

**The "Emergency Exit":** Beyond just launching, it adds a controller-based "Kill Combo." If Ryujinx hangs or you're done playing, you can force-close the emulator without ever leaving your seat.

**Visual & Intuitive:** Features a high-contrast side-rail UI with persistent pastel color-coding so you always know which controller belongs to which player at a glance.

**Tested on Windows 11 with Ryujinx v1.3.3/v1.3.2/v1.3.1/v1.1.1403**

## ⚠️ Important Usage Note
While you *can* run this launcher directly to set up your controllers before launching Ryujinx, **game selection will still require a mouse to navigate.**

**The ideal use cases:** 
1) **Middleware**: Use this launcher as Middleware for frontends like **Playnite, Moonlight, Artemis**. When used this way, the frontend handles game selection, and this launcher handles the controller setup, creating a seamless, mouse-free experience from start to finish.
2) **Drop-in Replacement**: This launcher works as a direct replacement for any script, shortcut, command line argument or any other frontend that supports custom emulator paths. Wherever you currently use: `Ryujinx.exe <GamePath>`. You can simply replace it with: `RyujinxLauncher.exe <GamePath>`

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Standard Method (Recommended)

Simply place `RyujinxLauncher.exe` inside your main Ryujinx directory (the same folder where `Ryujinx.exe` is located).

```text
C:\Games\Ryujinx\
    ├── Ryujinx.exe
    ├── RyujinxLauncher.exe  <-- Place here
    ├── Ryujinx.SDL2.Common.dll.config
    └── SDL2.dll

```
### 2. Advanced Method (Custom Path)

If you prefer to keep the launcher in a different folder than your emulator, you can manually link them:

1. Create a new text file named `RyujinxPath.config` in the same folder as the launcher.
    - Important: You must delete the .txt extension. The final file name must be exactly `RyujinxPath.config` (not `RyujinxPath.config.txt`).
2. Open it and paste the full path to your Ryujinx folder inside.
3. Save the file.

Example `RyujinxPath.config` content: `D:\emulators\Ryujinx`

**⚠️ Warning**: If you are unsure what this means, please use the **Standard Method above**. This step is only for users who need a specific custom folder structure.

## 🛠️ Building from Source

If you wish to modify the code or build the executable yourself.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Directory Structure
Ensure your source folder looks like this before building:

```text
ProjectRoot/
├── assets/
│   ├── RyujinxLauncherIcon.ico
│   └── RyujinxLauncherPNG.png
├── src/
│   └── RyujinxLauncher.py
└── requirements.txt
```

### Build Command

Run this command from the ProjectRoot terminal to create a standalone EXE/BIN/APP with bundled assets:

### Windows

`pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "RyujinxLauncher" --icon="assets\RyujinxLauncherIcon.ico" --add-data "assets;assets" src\RyujinxLauncher.py`

### MacOS

`pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "RyujinxLauncher" --icon="assets/RyujinxLauncherIcon.ico" --add-data "assets:assets" src/RyujinxLauncher.py`

### Linux

`pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "RyujinxLauncher" --icon="assets/RyujinxLauncherPNG.png" --add-data "assets:assets" src/RyujinxLauncher.py`

The resulting `RyujinxLauncher` executable will be in the `dist/` folder.

## ❓ FAQ

   **Q: Does this replace Ryujinx?**  
   A: No, it's a companion launcher. You still need Ryujinx installed.

   **Q: Will this work with other emulators?**  
   A: No, it's specifically designed for Ryujinx's config format.

   **Q: Does this work with LaunchBox/RetroBat/EmulationStation?**  
   A: Yes! Just point the emulator path to `RyujinxLauncher.exe` instead of `Ryujinx.exe`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Controllers Not Detected**  
✅ Ensure SDL2.dll is in the same folder as Ryujinx.exe  
✅ Try unplugging and reconnecting controllers  
✅ Check Windows Device Manager for "Unknown USB Device"

**Launcher Crashes on Start**  
✅ Missing Config.json → Launch Ryujinx normally once to generate it  
✅ Missing SDL2.dll → Ensure it's in the same folder as Ryujinx.exe

**Kill Combo Not Working**  
✅ Hold all 3 buttons (⧉ + LB + RB) for ~1 second  
✅ Works on ANY connected controller, not just Player 1

**UI Too Small/Large**  
✅ The launcher auto-scales based on resolution  
✅ If scaling is wrong: Windows Settings → Display → Scale → 100%
